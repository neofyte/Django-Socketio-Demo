Django-Socketio-Demo
====================

This minimal example uses django together with gevent to implement a real-time chatroom (or a meeting room).

Introduction
============

This repo implements a real-time chatroom with websocket protocol, which is a substitution of tech such as ajax long polling etc. Socketio originally runs on node.js and chooses for browsers among websocket, long polling etc to implement real-time things. Websocket is different in that it is a server-push tech instead of a pulling tech eg. long polling. Interested reader can google for more info about this tech. An expository article can be found on IBM developer site. (Google it)

Further Furnishment
===================

I will try to add redis and other celery, mq stuff.

- Python27
